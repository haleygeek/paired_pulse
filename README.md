This program takes raw data from a paired pulse experiment and calculates the paired-pulse ratio, saving the PPR in a separate sheet


Each experiment should be organized as:

    Column 1 = interstimulus interval

    Column 2 = raw slope or amplitude of pulse 1
  
    Column 3 = raw slope or amplitude of pulse 2
  

Analyzed PPR will be output to a new sheet named "Your Sheet PPR"

    For each experiment:
  
    Column 1 = interstimulus interval
  
    Column 2 = paired pulse ratio
